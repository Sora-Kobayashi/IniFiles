* S_TextLimit.ini

This file is self explanatory:

| INT_COUNT | BAD_WORD | REPETITION(?) |

You can use the words in the list to forbid what can and cannot be said.

=In my opinion:= A true server with no crybabies use nothing inside this file but the version. Free speech and let them kill theirselves in PvP.
