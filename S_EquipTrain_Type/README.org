* S_Equip_Train_Type

This file is related to how you grow stats in your equip by giving it experience.

It's basic a table with no ID, just the attribute and where you can use it.

| ATTRIBUTE | PART_OF_USE1 | ... | PART_OF_USE_N ||

Where PART_OF_USE is the part of the equipment that can or canot use depending on the value recived.

*1: on*\\
*<blank space>: off*

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* If you try to use any number that isn't 1 your server WON'T START. (In fact your client will be stuck at character selection).

*= CUSTOM STATS, they exist, but if you put they will not work as well. They'd get the min value of signed 4 bytes. -2,157B\\
So it's not recommended to use since they're not unsigned.
